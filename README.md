This is a pure Javascript library for creating pie charts that can be adjusted on the fly:

    r = Raphael(0, 0, 500, 500)
    chart = r.piechart(250, 250, 100, [10, 22, 32, 2, 18])

Obviously, a work in progress.  Loosely based on Dmitry Baranovskiy's examples [here](http://raphaeljs.com/pie.html), [here](http://raphaeljs.com/growing-pie.html) and [here](http://g.raphaeljs.com/piechart2.html).
